## Screen Addiction: Cause and Control

Hello! Take your eyes off this magazine and glance around for a moment. What do you observe? You will see people using their phones, laptops or other electronic gadgets, with their eyes set on screens. This phenomenon is known as screen usage, and it has become an essential part of our lives.

The world is at our fingertips. Be it information, entertainment, fun, or food; everything is accessible by a couple of taps on our gadgets. In spite of the fact that these devices are advantageous in many prospects, the time spent on them results in some major side effects. 

We are regularly killing most of our time looking onto a screen. From binge-watching our favorite shows to working on a project, most of our time is spent sitting before a screen. This is the precise definition of "Screen addiction". With the internet being easily and economically available to all; it is becoming predominant with each passing moment. We have already reached a point where we have acknowledged its normalcy and blissfully ignored the humongous problem it is becoming.
 
Nowadays, we do not even try to remember things we actually might know - facts, names of celebrities, important dates etc. All we need to do is whip up our phones or laptops and do a quick search to get all the answers we need. As convenient as it sounds, we end up being lazier by each search query.

Social media and entertainment apps/sites play another important part in this ever-increasing screen fetish among people. Almost everyone uses at least one social media website or application. Content provided by these are endless, and according to a person's preferences they can watch a substantial amount, making us procrastinators, lazy and addicted to screens. 

Instant messaging apps like Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp have their users' eyes glued to the screens. Though they are useful and have brought the world much closer, they are causing problems too. Since it is much easier to reach people than ever, we don't take even a moment to figure out minor inconveniences on our own.

Recently, a woman from Taiwan was found to have 500 holes in her cornea due to excessive use of the phone on maximum brightness.
In a recent survey by Huwawei, conducted in Australia, it was found that running out of battery is a subject of strain for people. 

Self-control is first and foremost to control screen addiction or any addiction whatsoever. App makers and operating system developers are also taking measures to counter this problem.

For instance, PUBG(Tencent Corporation) and Google's Android are going to take measures to control screen addiction in their users.

Google has been providing statistical data on app usage to users so that they can track their usage and observe their behavior.
YouTube has added a feature using which users can see how much time they use the app.
Also, the latest version of Android will be providing an app called "Digital Wellbeing", which will remind users to take breaks from the screen.
For older versions of Android and IOS, there are third-party apps available which can be used to prevent phone addiction. Such apps or software are available for computers and smart TVs as well.
Apart from using apps and tools for limiting our phone usage, there are some psychological tricks which can be used too. To stop the urge to touch gadgets, turn off all the useless notification alerts, use the *do not disturb* mode, and set some ground rules for phone usage. Replace the time spent in using phones with some other activity, such as reading.


Modern technology has provided us with a wide range of gadgets that have opened a seamless world of information and entertainment. But, their misuse and overuse are leading to various health and psychological problems. It is up to us to use technology carefully and not end up being addicted.
