Recently, Uber has selected India among 5 global locations outside USA for launching UBER ELEVATE. Yes, this seems to be a dream but its reality. UBER has made a good step choosing India because of its growing population and congestion on roads in metro cities. Uber Air will start its test flights in Dallas-Fort Worth/Frisco Texas and Los Angeles in 2020 with commercial flights starting 2023. India, Japan, Australia, France, and Brazil are the nominated countries for the third, international, destination for Uber Air flights. For an urban air taxi, the ideal launch city will be a dense metropolitan area where traffic congestion can mean that even distances of 10-15 kilometers can take an hour. Thus, Indian cities qualify quite well.

### WHAT AIRCRAFT UBER AIR WILL USE

Helicopters are costly and noisy. Hence, Uber is planning to use eVTOL aircraft for the Elevate programme. This aircraft will be powered by a battery, will take off and land vertically, fly the said distance on a single charge and have a certain amount of autonomous ability.
But what about the prices? Will it be affordable for the regular commuter?
Well, the prices might be prohibitive for the masses. Even if there are a smaller percentage of people that are able to afford at a certain price point, it still can be a very large absolute number (in India).

### WHAT ARE THE MAJOR CHALLENGES

There are many challenges at the moment. To start with, the type of aircraft itself has not been finalized — will it be a winged model or something that works like a drone? Then, there is this challenge pertaining to the battery which should be able to sustain the charge for a 100-km flight. The major impediment are the sky ports where the aircraft will take off and land as well as be charged and maintained. Sky ports have to be in central locations for the concept to take off and that will have a huge cost implication.

### How will air mobility help cut congestion?

Uber wants to de-hyphenate transportation from surface transport which has always been path-based. Air mobility is a node-based facility where each node can be connected to any of the other nodes. Uber cites the examples of India, where CST to Mumbai airport or Gurgaon to Connaught Place commute would be reduced to just 10 minutes, thus saving the users at least two hours every day. Uber’s estimate is that urban congestion costs India alone \$22 billion a year. So, let's hope that by 2023 we will be flying away to our relatives’ houses via a quick and hassle-free ride instead of taking a six-hour drive on the highway.

To conclude, India is growing in technology with time. If successful, 2023 will see a new regime of urban transport where reaching from source to destination will take negligible time without any hustle of traffic jams. The major challenge for India now is to make this proposed transporting system a success.
