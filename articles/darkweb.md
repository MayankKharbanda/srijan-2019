An enormous unexplored part of Deep web is the illicit Dark Web. The World Wide Web is made up of Surface Web, Deep Web and Dark Web.

The Surface Web, commonly known as Visible Web, is that formed by websites that are indexed which means that they can be found through common search engines. Surprisingly, less than 5% of the web falls under this category. That is through our web search engines we can only access 5% of the World Wide Web.
The Deep Web or Invisible Web is that portion of the internet whose contents are inaccessible to basic web search engines. These contents are hidden behind HTTP forms. This includes webmail, online banking and other services that users must pay for and hence protected using a payment gateway. Thus, it requires additional authentications for accessing beyond the public web page using a direct URL.
Lastly, the Dark Web, also referred to as the darknet, is an encrypted portion of the internet that is not indexed by search engines. This consists of web resources or web pages that can only be accessed with technologies that ensure a user’s anonymity. 
Dark Web is often portrayed as a platform of enigmatic and criminal activities because of its anonymity. The websites in Dark Web have a special URL which is tailed up with onion extension. [websitename].onion (e.g. torprojectqyqhjn.onion) domains are not indexed by regular search engines, and hence you can only access Dark Web with special software.
Popularly known as “Evil Twin” of Internet!
About $500,000 is believed to be generated from Dark Web in transactions daily. Users can purchase fake passports for as little as $1,000.00. Bitcoin lottery tickets, fake coupons, and even fake degrees can all be had for the right price. Dark Web is just a small part of Deep Web. This technology has led to the creation of drug markets within the traffic where restricted drugs are being sold and purchased. 
How to reach Dark Web?
Reaching the dark web is just like peeling an onion...
Onion routing is an anonymous networking technique. In an onion network, the messages are bound in various layers of encryption, similar to layers of an onion. Onion Routing prevents the transport medium from knowing who is communicating with whom – that is network remains unaware of the fact that which user is requesting some service from the server. So, Onion routing maintains anonymity.  
Each of the systems that are connected to the Onion network is identified as a node. The messages are encrypted constantly. These messages are hopped several times from one network node to another network node. These network nodes called ‘Onion Routers’ creates a node circuit. At each node, a layer of encryption is removed with its symmetric key and forwards the message to the next onion router where the same job is executed. 

A white paper on the Dark Web which monitored over 30,000 top-level sites or .onion (Hidden Services) was released by ZeroDayLab’s partner Intelliagg. 
Key findings from the research include:
•    At the time of assessment, only 46% of the 30,000 hidden services analyzed were active.
•    76% of the sites were in English, unsurprisingly Chinese and German as second and third languages.

•    48% of the sites were classified as illegal.

•    With the manual classification of over 1,000 sites, it was deemed that 68% of the content was illegal according to US and UK law.

•    The top classifications of hidden marketplaces were file sharing (29%), leaked data (28%), and financial fraud (12%). Unexpectedly, hacking only covered up 3% of the sites interrogated.

•    Interestingly, 39% of sites analyzed were unlinked, meaning they were extremely difficult to find.
