We all are fairly active on social media as well as on modern-day applications but does it ever occur to us, that is our data safe? Or are we being fooled by these big companies?
The increasing news on data breach including Facebook and Google data leaks alarmed people all across the world. How could such things ever happen to us? How could our information be leaked? 
We have been trusting these companies with our data for years and now the trust is at an all-time low.
The social media was quick to report the incident, which allowed the hackers to exploit a weakness in Facebook’s code to access the ‘View As’ privacy tool. But failed to provide clear advice to users following the breach.
People don’t realize how much access they have given to companies like Facebook and Google by simply providing their location and personal information. We usually don’t even bother to read the Privacy Policy and accept it, allowing them to use our information to target us with personalized advertisements.
# Google knows what you're looking for. Facebook knows what you like. Sharing is the norm, and secrecy is out.

Some unbelievable findings of Facebook and Google that may lead you to question your decisions twice before taking any action on these platforms :
●    87 million people ’s information was shared with Cambridge Analytica by Facebook.
●    In October 2018, Facebook admitted data breach affecting over 50 million people.
●    According to Facebook, malicious hackers took advantage of Facebook’s search tools to discover the identities and collect information of most of its two billion users worldwide over the course of several years.
●    In 2016, Facebook was fined $1.44 million for the collection of data on people’s ideologies and religious beliefs, sex, and personal tastes by Spain.
●    In 2016, Facebook used your location data to suggest friends without asking for your permission.
●    In August 2012, Google was sued by the FTC for by-passing security measures in Apple devices and using the secret code to bypass Safari’s anti-tracking measures.
●    It was observed that Google Home Mini records your home at all times even if you don’t say “OK Google.” This software flaw has been subsequently fixed by Google.
●    The recent complaint against YouTube, a subsidiary of Google, has been collecting information from children under the age of 13 without obtaining prior parental consent, as required by law.
●    In 2014, Google was sued over for disclosing the user data to advertisers without permission.
●    Between the years 2015 and March 2018, outside developers were able to potentially access personal Google+ profile data due to a software glitch in the site.


In conclusion, we have come to the end of *Privacy*. The public and the private sectors are collecting and using personal data at an unparalleled scale and for multifaceted purposes. While data can be put to beneficial use, the unregulated and arbitrary use of data, especially personal data, has raised huge concerns regarding the privacy and autonomy of an individual.
Companies are proving that they can not be trusted with people’s data.Cyber Security breaches will continue to take place, but trust in the technology companies and sites is falling.With GDPR (general data protection regulation)  stipulating huge fines for firms that fail to safeguard user data, perhaps things will improve. But For now, it’s up to the users to decide which technology companies they trust.
