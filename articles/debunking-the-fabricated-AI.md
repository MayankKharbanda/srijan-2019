### What is Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence. If you're not living under a rock you must have heard of this term. And if
you do know, you must be fascinated by it. After all, the words say it all. In layman's term -
intelligence that has been created.

A simple google search will come up with hundreds of articles, books, media, movies devoted to
it. And images. ​Abundant ​ images.

Neurons firing, robots thinking, code pouring down a screen and if you're lucky you might as
well find " The Terminator " buried somewhere in there.

But is this how we define AI? An omnipotent robot? Or is it just something Hollywood fancies us
to buy?

Perhaps, it is easier to connect to an audience via these clichés. But do we need them today? In
the age of Alexa, Cortana, face detection in mobile phones and Google Maps, do we really
require false depiction of AI?

This is how Wikipedia defines AI.
" Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural
intelligence displayed by humans and other animals. Colloquially, the term 'artificial intelligence'
is applied when a machine mimics 'cognitive' functions that humans associate with other human
minds, such as 'learning' and 'problem solving'. ​ "

### Some myths about AI
Now that we have a formal definition of what it is, let's counter some myths that plague this field.
1 . AI = Robots .
No. AI is any machine that has the property of exhibiting intelligence, performing tasks that
are an essence of human intelligence.
Sure, a robot does employ concepts of AI, but the keyword is "use".
A machine that can recognise images is AI, perhaps limited in its scope but nevertheless - AI.
2. AI = Machine Learning .
Machine Learning(ML) is a subset of AI. Machine Learning is only a means of achieving AI. A
faster, smarter, efficient way.
If we had to create a program that recognises trees from a photo, we could possibly write it in
code.
How long would it be? Well, long enough to cause a headache.
So, instead of writing complex rules and specifications to achieve a goal,
we make use of ML.
Machine learning is "training" an algorithm so that it learns the objective. Training involves
feeding it a huge amount of data so that it adjusts, improves and eventually learn.
4. AI can work with any variety of data
Certainly, but when your face recognition system says you look like a car, it doesn't take long
to dawn upon you that something went amiss. Any AI system needs high-quality information that
pertains to the problem at hand; data with some noise (unstructured, meaningless data) is fine
but that noise can't be a heavy - metal song; ​pun intended ​. AI is a program and a program
needs good data.
5. AI will rule over the world .
If we go by any conventional science-fiction movie on the matter of AI, yes. In real life, No.
Ever since "AI" transcended from academic knowledge to general circulation, it has been
fashioned, manipulated, had its purpose changed.
Likening the power of an AI-powered machine to that of a human in power is imaginative but
essentially, bizarre.

Today's AI is a snail against what it actually can be. A smart machine will operate for us. It won't
destroy but rather enrich our lives.
Semantics cannot be created from syntactic logic.
Machines will always require human input and intervention.
And the said machines will be smart enough to assess the significance of its creator - us.
Maybe there is a threat, but that kind of revolution hasn't happened yet.
Besides, if we are capable of recognising an intimidation that is unreachable today we are more
than proficient of treating it.
The hype created by pop culture shouldn't be a hindrance in research, inventiveness and
innovation.
AI is already a part of our lives. It's time we ask questions that help us comprehend it - what it
is, what it is not, what it can be and what impact it will have on our lives.
