Yes, you heard it right. In the foreseeable future, thinking about the plastic switches on our walls that control different appliances will fill us with nostalgia. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and Disney Research have developed a way to make walls smart.

At a cost of $20 per metre, with a few coatings of conductive paint and some electronics, they have managed to transform plain and simple walls into smart ones. These walls can sense human touch, detect gestures and recognize appliances in use.

Chris Harrison, an assistant professor in Carnegie Mellon University’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) says that although walls are usually the structure with the largest surface area in a room, they are not used much. Other than to separate spaces, hold up pictures and attach shelves, walls are not used in their capacity. He further states - as the Internet of Things and ubiquitous computing become reality, walls becoming an active part of our living is intrigue in itself.

Dubbed as Wall++, the researches use the following procedure: Using painter’s tape, they create a cross-hatched pattern on a wall to create a grid of diamonds. Tests have shown that this is the most effective electrode pattern. Afterward, an application of two coats of conductive paint is applied. Then the tape is removed and electrodes are connected. At last, the wall is finished with a top coat of standard latex paint in order to improve durability and hide the electrodes.

The electrode wall can be operated in two modes— capacitive sensing and electromagnetic(EM) sensing. In capacitive sensing, the wall functions like any other capacitive touchpad. When a person touches the wall, its electrostatic field gets distorted at that point. In EM sensing mode, the electrodes distinguish between the distinctive electromagnetic signatures of electrical or electronic devices in order to enable the system to identify them and their exact locations.

This system has lots of potential. It can monitor activity in a room, adjust the temperature and even provide alerts when an appliance is turned off. It can also track people wearing electronic devices by detecting their electromagnetic signature.

As intimidating as this seems, there is still a long way to go. Wall++ has not yet been optimized for energy consumption, says Yang Zhang, a Ph.D. student at HCII. He estimates the electrodes will consume as much power as a standard touch screen. Though the general functionality seems to be sound, an alternative to installing sensor boards on each wall is required. If achieved, the technology will be a game-changer in almost every sector.

To conclude, the future seems bright for Wall++. Walls might literally have ears and a voice, and we will be able to ask them the million dollar question - Who is Alexa?
